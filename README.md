# filename-changer
This is a simple script to change the name of multiple files


I have created this script to automatically rename music files I have where every song starts with the band's name: band_name - music_name.
I have many songs where the file is named only after the song's name and wanted something better to rename it instead of having myself to do it manually.
I created this for renaming songs but it can be used to rename multiple files you want.


In order for this script to properly run you need to have the folder where the files are next in the alt-tab area and the first file must be selected.
